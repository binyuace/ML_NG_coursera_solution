Dear All,
 
The provisional timetables, the Module description booklets and the Module Choice Forms have now been placed on the ?Useful Information for All Mathematics Students: 2016-2017? Canvas section.
 
Please note that the timetable is still provisional and that some non-compulsory modules may not run if there is insufficient student interest.
 
Hard copies of the module choice forms are available from the grey wall-mounted file holders outside of the Mathematics Teaching Support Office.
 
The School of Mathematics will hold Transition group meetings in the Main Lecture Theatre of the Aston Webb Building on Wednesday 14 June to help students with their modules choices as follows:
(a)    Year 3 to Year 4: 10-11
(b)    Year 2 to Year 3: 11-12:30
(c)    Year 1 to Year 2: 12:30-2:00
 
Students are expected to discuss their module choice forms with their personal tutor during the compulsory progress review tutorials on Thursday 15 or Friday 16 June.
 
Finally, please check your e-mail and social media: I have heard rumours of a student-led module choice event that may involve pizza.
 
Best wishes,
 
David
